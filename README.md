# Grimsoft-Coding-Curriculum
This is a Curriculum designed to bring learners into the world of the developer.  The focus here is not on any particular language or framework.

## Aims and Principles

### Principles

- The way of the coder, is more improtant than the code itself
- Programming is problem solving, The aim is to look at basic problems, and examine the problem solving process in order to develop skills to solve other problems later.


### Aims

- To teach the 'how' of development in a context that allows problems to be solved.
- To teach the basics of coding formats in markdown, markup, web languages, and python.
- To raise awareness of resources and tools to solve problems.



## Overview

### Part 0
In part 0 we will be dealing with a number of tools and environments which allow collaboration, and problems to be solved iteratively.

Key tools:
- [github](www.github.com)
- [Cloud9 ](http://c9.io)

- Git
- Markdown

### Part 1
In part 1 we will be looking at basic math problems in Python.  Math problems in this sense will involve string, Integer and float datatypes.
